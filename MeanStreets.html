                    <span> <strong>  The first time I watched Mean Streets </strong></span> I was dismissive of the movie as I had a preconception that this is an old and early Scorsese movie and since a lot of people don’t regularly talk about it, it has to be an okay-ish movie. So, I wasn't into the movie that much and it felt like there was no plot or anything. But the filmmaking aspect of Scorsese was lingering in my head for a while after watching it.

                    <span><strong>But on rewatch...</strong></span> I knew what I was going in for, so I really started engaging with the film. I started to understand the characters and their motivations especially our protagonist Charlie. The guilt for his actions and his inner struggle for redeeming his sins. The ideology he follows "Sins can't be redeemed in the church until there's a true inner realization and acceptance for them", for which he tries to help Johnny boy by risking his position with the mob. I actually understood the thoughts of Charlie and it made all the difference in my viewing of the film. The girl he's with but cannot publicly admit he loves, his friendship with Johnny boy, his qualms with going out with a black girl fearing judgement from his circle, his remorse for the sins he thinks he commits all these come together to make Charlie a perfectly written character.

                    <span><strong>The Filmmaking of Mean Streets</strong></span>, I adore. Mean Streets was made on a very low budget. Purchasing the song rights took up a major chunk of that already small budget. This means Scorsese had to utilize the leftover money appropriately. This resulted in the mostly handheld camerawork of Mean Streets which was innovative and really enhances the movie stylistically and gives the raw natured feel it has. The colours, especially the reds, used in the film also gives it a unique style. The music in this film is so cool. Harvey Keitel gives an amazing performance. Seriously. I love him in this movie.

                    <span><strong>In conclusion</strong></span>, I wish I could say this was Scorsese's debut but it wasn't. This was definitely the one that put him on the map. This also gave de Niro his big break and also marks the first collaboration of him and Scorsese who would go on to make nine other important pieces of cinema. That way I'd argue this was one the important movies for cinema itself. Another amazing quality I felt in this was hoe personal it feels to the director. It looks like he knows every character, the neighborhood and the place’s culture. And it indeed is personal to Scorsese as he grew up in the place. This film has really grown on me and become one of my favourites.
